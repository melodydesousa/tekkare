## 👩‍💻 Technical Choices

This project was built using the following technologies:

### Frontend

- **React.js**: The main framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For navigating between pages (e.g., from the list of hospitals to a detailed page).
- **ApexCharts**: Used to create interactive charts.
- **TypeScript**: Used to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.

### State Management

- **useState** and **useEffect** hooks were used to manage local state and side effects, including sorting and updating chart data dynamically when props change.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the UI components. Tailwind provides utility-first classes, which allow for quick and consistent styling across the app.

### Icons

- Custom **SVG icons** were used.
